# Gene jacknifing scripts from Sharanowski et al. 2010

These scripts require [Psy](https://github.com/mjy/psy), which does (did?) a ton of cool stuff back in the day. Psy handled hundreds of secondary structure partitions, today it might be useful for hundreds of genes in phylogenomic work.

Psy is no longer supported, but does have unit tests etc., and was a decently curated set of code.
